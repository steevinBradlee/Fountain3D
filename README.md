# Fountain3D
Fountain3D - A 3D remake of 'Fountain' by Terry Cavanagh.  
Final year Computer Graphics CS4052 project.

For my final year graphics project I created a 3D game inspired by 'Fountain', a 2D game by designer Terry Cavanagh. The game was implemented in C++ using OpenGL 4. All relevant code, libraries (32 bit versions) and assets are included as well as the Visual Studio 2010 program (yes I wrote it in Visual Studio, calm down).
